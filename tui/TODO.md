# TODO

## Upcoming
- `5`. Filter problems by status, sort by acceptance, basic search queries.
- `3`. Fetch previous submitions so as to not only bring boilerplate files.
- `2`. Run test cases.
- `2`. Submit code.
- `7`. See a nice panel with the execution results.
- `3`. Prepend the hidden header imports leetcode doesn't supply through their API.
- `5`. Take care of the code, deduplicate code everywhere (mainly renders).
- `1`. Put some comments explaining every method (if required).

# EXTRA IDEAS

- `5`. Integrate git into the main application, whenever the user submits code, commit the current state of the .leetui directory and maybe even push to some remote repo.
- `4`. Integrate with terminal multiplexers such as zellij and tmux to show both the editor and panel at the same time.
