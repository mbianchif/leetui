# TODO

## Priorities
1. Take care of the code, deduplicate code everywhere (mainly renders).
1. Put some comments explaining every method (if required).
1. Open the code editor on the selected files.

## Upcoming
1. Filter problems by status, sort by acceptance, basic search queries.
1. Fetch previous submitions so as to not only bring boilerplate files.
1. Run test cases.
1. Submit code.
1. See a nice panel with the execution results.
1. Detach from code editor so as to not lose context of the open files whenever one wants to use the panel.
1. Prepend the hidden header imports leetcode doesn't supply through their API.
1. Maybe show the description in the panel (maybe). It'd be nice at least in the file selector.

# EXTRA IDEAS

1. Integrate git into the main application, whenever the user submits code, commit the current state of the .leetui directory and maybe even push to some remote repo.
1. Integrate with terminal multiplexers such as zellij and tmux to show both the editor and panel at the same time.
